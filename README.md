# Decryptor
CS32 Project. Produce an encrypted message (or decrypt an encrypted message) in which each letter in the alphabet maps to a unique, different letter in the alphabet. In order to decrypt the message, the program goes through a dictionary of possible words, matching character patterns and testing different letters until a valid phrase or sentence can be decrypted.
